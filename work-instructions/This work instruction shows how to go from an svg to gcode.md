This work instruction shows how to go from an [.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG) file, previously created with [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), and used with  to [gcodetools](https://github.com/cnc-club/gcodetools) to carve three primitive first editions of the "sto" of toad***sto***ol.

The file is called [Toadstool Logo Scaled to 30 inches wide - sto.svg](https://github.com/pflagerd/toadstool-logo/blob/master/Toadstool%20Logo%20Scaled%20to%2030%20inches%20wide%20-%20sto.svg)

I abandoned gcodetools in favor of [Carveco Maker](https://carveco.com/carveco-software-range/carveco-maker/), even though [Carveco Maker](https://carveco.com/carveco-software-range/carveco-maker/) only runs on Windows and is a subscription product.

The first thing to do here is to remove the gcodetools-created components of the drawing, which include the rectangle and the origin, and all the little arrows.

Step 1 is to open the file with Inkscape as shown above. You can see this process [here](https://github.com/pflagerd/toadstool-logo/blob/master/videos/How%20to%20remove%20gcodetools-generated%20components%20of%20inkscape%20drawing.mkv)
